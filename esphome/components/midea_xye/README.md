# Overview

This component communicates with Midea-like air conditioners (heat pumps) via the XYE protocol over RS485.
Kudos to these projects:
- Reverse engineering of the protocol: https://codeberg.org/xye/xye
- Working implementation using ESP32: https://github.com/Bunicutz/ESP32_Midea_RS485
- Fully integrated Midea Climate component: https://github.com/esphome/esphome/tree/dev/esphome/components/midea

To get this to work you need an esphome configuration like this:

```yaml
esphome:
  name: heatpump
  friendly_name: Heatpump

esp8266:  #also works with esp32
  board: d1_mini

# Enable logging (but not via UART)
logger:
  baud_rate: 0

external_components:
  - source: 
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/exciton/esphome
      ref: dev
    components: [midea_xye]
  
# UART settings for RS485 covnerter dongle (required)
uart:
  tx_pin: TX
  rx_pin: RX
  baud_rate: 4800
  debug: #If you want to help reverse engineer
    direction: BOTH

# What works
- Setting mode (off, auto, fan, cool, heat, dry).
- Setting temperature. Can send in C or F. Handles AC results in C or F. Must manually set in YAML.
- Setting fan mode (auto, low, med, high).
- Reading inside, outside air temperatures, inside coil temperature, and outside coil temperature.
- Reading timer start/stop times (set by remote)
- Follow-Me temperature. Point it at a sensor and this works well.

# What doesn't work
- Current reading always shows 255
- Setting swing mode 

# Not yet implemented
- Setting timers direct to unit. No real need since automations can do this 
- Figure out how to force display to C or F. Setting temp in C doesn't force display to C.
- Freeze protection
- Silent mode
- Lock/Unlock

# Not tested
- IR integration (However, not needed for Follow-Me)
